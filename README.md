## Working
  Once the form is filled, validation will be fired for each field. When the validation is unsuccessful, the data wont be submitted to the firebase. 
  Only when there is successful validation the data will get submitted to the firebase. After successful submission, you'll still be able to edit the data and when everything is finalised, again the same entry in firebase will be refreshed.
